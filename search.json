    "text": "I have developed a broad teaching portfolio, instructing courses across in-person, online synchronous, and online asynchronous formats. My experience includes being the instructor of record for 10 undergraduate courses across two subjects, mathematics and economics, with class sizes ranging from 15 to 100 students. I was honored to receive the University of Oregon Economics Department Graduate Teaching Award for Online Instruction for the 2024-2025 academic year, which is awarded based on cumulative teaching accomplishments and qualitative student feedback. My teaching style relies heavily on connecting with and getting to know my students. Through flipped classroom days, in-class experiments, and multiple assessment methods, I structure my classes to empower students to develop the inductive reasoning skills required to think “like an economist.” Below you will find information about the courses I have taught, example syllabi, and selected student comments."

    "text": "Working Papers\nAll working papers available upon request.\nSports Betting Legalization and Family Risk: Evidence from Child Protective Services Investigations\n\n\nThis study explores the unintended consequences of sports betting legalization on child maltreatment. Using administrative Child Protective Services case data and a staggered difference-in-differences framework, I estimate the causal effect of sports gambling on the number, type, and disposition of maltreatment investigations. I find that following sports gambling legalization, states experience a higher rate of investigations of maltreatment. The effect is driven by states that legalize mobile sports betting and is experienced by primarily white children. Rural areas experience a slightly higher increase in the rate of reports relative to urban areas. Based on previous literature, I outline two potential pathways for these effects: an amplification of emotional cues from bad sports/gambling outcomes, and the family stress of accumulated financial hardship. While reports of child maltreatment generally increase following unexpected losses of local football teams, I do not find that this is amplified by legal gambling. Instead, the long horizon over which effects emerge suggests a financial hardship pathway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether in Purpose, Not Persona: Leader Identity’s impact on Volunteer Effort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of nonprofits, I explore the effect of a leader’s gender and sexuality on volunteer motivation. I propose an experiment using both stated and revealed measures to investigate the effect of a leader’s identity on volunteers attitudes and performance. I find that women in positions of leadership are rated as more typical more effective than their male peers. I do not find evidence that leader gender or sexuality have a direct effect on follower performance. I discuss how follower’s group identities and their personal attitudes towards the nonprofit they are volunteering for interact with these results.\n\n\n\n\nWorks in Progress\nArtifical Aging and Face Morphing: Testing the Double Standard of Aging Hypothesis\nwith Mary Kite\n\n\n\nWe introduce a novel method, artificial aging and face morphing, to test how people perceive old age based on a target’s gender and race. Undergraduates (N = 170) were shown six slide decks with automatic progression in the lab which showed a face transitioning from young to old (or old to young). Participants were instructed to stop the slide deck when the face had started to look old (young). The stopped frame value was recorded for each video. Participants then reported their thoughts while doing the morphs, provided attractiveness ratings and age anchors for all of the faces they viewed, and completed a demographic questionnaire. The stopped frame was compared by a 4 (Target Race) X 2 (Target Gender) ANOVA. Results showed significant main effects for target gender (p &lt; 0.009), target race (p &lt; 0.03), and an interaction effect between race and gender (p &lt; 0.03). I will introduce the results in the context of stopped frames and open up a discussion on the value of imputing target race as an alternative.\nFaces retrieved from Chicago Face Database\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo"

    "text": "Phillips Exeter Academy\nSince 2023, I spend my summers teaching at a middle and high school enrichment program at Phillips Exeter Academy by the name of Exeter Summer.\nPhillips Exeter Academy is a coeducational residential high school located in Exeter, New Hampshire. During the summer, PEA/Exeter Summer offers non-degree seeking enrichment to more than 600 middle and high school students from the U.S. and more than thirty foreign countries.\nAs a Summer Faculty member, I am charged with adapting college-level curriculum to the high school classroom through the use of the Harkness Method. Harkness is a student centered style of learning where students teach one another through shared ideas and questions with minimal teacher intervention.\nTeaching at Exeter Summer has allowed me to think, teach, and develop curriculum outside of the traditional chalk-and-talk format. Throughout my tenure, I have developed the curriculum for four summer courses:\n\n\nEconomics in the Labratory\nThis course teaches introductory economic theory to high school students through discussions, in-class experiments, and problem sets. A standard unit starts with students reading an article about an example of the phenomena or behavior we plan to study. Students are then given space to collectively generate a hypothesis to test related to the outcome. They then participate in an experiment selected to generate evidence students use to evaluate their hypothesis. From this point, students are given a hand out formalizing the mathematic notation of their hypothesis and asked to worth through other examples to solidfy their comfort with the math.\nInvesting in a Changing World\nEvery dollar we invest is a choice, not just about growing our wealth but about the kind of world we want to help build. In this course, we will explore how investment decisions can promote sustainability and social betterment. We will uncover ways to delivers returns and supports projects like clean water access, affordable housing, or climate resilience. We will constantly ask ourselves, “what should I do when my financial goals conflict with my values?” We will wrestle with this and many other questions through case studies, portfolio-building exercises, ethical dilemmas, and group discussions.\n\n\n\nRules We Live By: Economics in Daily Life\nWhy does the Katy Freeway in Houston, Texas with its 26 lanes still experience traffic? This course explores the often hidden reasons behind our daily experiences. Students will learn how to create models as a way to simplify society to make sense of how it functions. We start with a shared question and each student is tasked to propose a model to explain it. In class, students come together, debate the merits of their models, and identify a single model they believe best explains the circumstances with the fewest assumptions.\nMarketing: Dignified Digital Design\nThis introductory marketing course explores how and why consumers make decisions. Students will learn the basics of identifying target markets, designing effective distribution and pricing strategies, and creating clear communication and promotional plans. The course also introduces tools for budgeting and evaluating marketing performance. By the end, students will be able to critically assess marketing practices and distinguish between those that are ethical and those that are not."

There is plenty of opportunity for the class to have a discussion. I also like it when Eric allows us to use our intuition to drive some parts of the discussion. The open questions to the class allow us to use our own knowledge to understand the material.”\n“He gave me so much support and always answered my emails fast. Genuinely the best Econ teacher I’ve ever had. I like how you interacted with the students and actually made the lectures fun. Also did a really good job of explaining everything visually.”\n“I think he is a great instructor and his overall enthusiasm for the content of the course is a refreshing take on something with economics. Overall an amazing class and much better than the first one I took my freshman year and failed.”\n“Mr. Wilken was always ready to help whoever needed it, all you had to do was ask. It’s obvious he truly enjoys his job, and loves to help others. I never felt nervous to raise my hand, because I knew in his class, truly no question was a stupid question.”\n“As someone who has taken MATH 125 twice before, Mr. Wilken is the clearest, helpful and most understanding professor I have had for this class. He’s extremely open to helping his students and is one of the most academically available professors I’ve had in my four years here. His in-class lectures are very helpful and his time management of class is extremely organized and structured. The biggest thing though is he is very understanding of every students situation in having other courses or even making adjustments to working from home. He’s been the best math teacher I’ve had in years.”\n“I had taken a Ball State Dual Credit class in high school, exact same class but different professors, and I received two different spectrums of an instructor. This professor has been understanding and went above and beyond to provide feedback with assignments and gave multiple resources for explaining content.”"
